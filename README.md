# study_forge

Study Forge is a study tool app that I made for personal use, it contains simple features like note taking and supports md file reading and configuration.
It is still in its early stages hence the lack of features but here are the features I plan to add on future updates of this app:

- Notepad feature: This one is already implemented along with the MarkDown file support.
- Smart Reminder and Scheduling feature.
- PDF, PPT, DOCS, etc... file viewer.
- Folder and File Manager system.
- Study Session / Study Page: A page dedicated for zen | study time.

... Other feature may come up along the way as I enhance this app of mine to fit my personal needs.
